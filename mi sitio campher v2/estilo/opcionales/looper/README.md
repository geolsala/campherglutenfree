Cycle.js
=================

Cycle through your content without writing a single line of Javascript. To keep things simple, transition effects are optional and have been limited to slide and cross-fade. In browsers that don't support CSS transitions, jQuery's animate is used.

To get started, read the docs: http://rygine.com/projects/cycle.js/docs/
